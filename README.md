"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples 3 of or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

### Because it is very simple I modified the problem to:

"If we list all natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we will obtain 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find all multiples of 3 or 5, whose sum does not exceed 1000."

# Fibonacci Sum



"Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10
terms will be:    
####
          1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,84,... 
####
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."
